# Hey, It's Paul Kamau üëã

### Thanks for viewing my ML portfolio. Let me know if you have any questions on  [![](https://github.com/paulycloud/paulycloud/blob/main/assets/linkedin.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulmkamau/) [![](https://github.com/paulycloud/paulycloud/blob/main/assets/insta.png)](https://www.instagram.com/pauly.ai) 

I'm a Technical Account Manager at [Google](https://www.google.com) with a specialty in AI & ML with the goal to build, deploy, lead, teach, gain mastery and influence people in the field of Artificial Intelligence and its application across teams and businesses to bring about transformations with visionary outcomes.

I'm a certified [Google Professional Machine Learning Engineer](https://www.credential.net/5e0ee0b8-067e-4c50-92f7-33ce5e8bff6a) and [Google Professional Data Engineer](https://www.credential.net/121a35c2-7a3d-41b7-8e3a-002b1b86ac69) and moving closer each day to gaining mastery in TensorFlow, BigQuery ML, AutoML, AI APIs and overall Vertex AI best practice and use.

I've completed over 100 hours of learning materials on [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/paulkamau) and 116 labs [CloudSkillsBoost](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/profile/activity?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q%5Bcompleted_at_not_null%5D=1) 

Here's a catalog of my work in Machine learning across multiple streams.
