    "# 05: Creating a matrix factorization model to make movie recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "This project used a matrix factorization model in BigQuery ML to generate movie recommendations for a user using the public movielens dataset. This dataset contains explicit feedback data given a movie ID and User ID. The recommendation is based on rating scale (1-5), genre and other metadata info. The user_id and movie_id ratings dataset has 1,000,209 rows. The movie titles dataset has 3,883 rows. \n",

    "## Objective\n",
    "- Create an explicit recommendations model using the CREATE MODEL statement \n",
    "- Use the ML.EVALUATE function to evaluate the ML Models \n",
    "- Use the ML.WEIGHTS function to inspect the latent factor weights generated during training \n",
    "- Use the ML.RECOMMEND function to produce recommendations for a user. \n",

    "- Use the ML.RECOMMEND function to fetch all the ratings for the user-item pairs\n",
    "- Save the recommendation predictions to a table\n",
    "- Generate the top 5 recommendations per user. "
