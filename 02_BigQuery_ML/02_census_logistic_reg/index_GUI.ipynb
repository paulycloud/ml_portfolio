    "\n",
    "This project used a binary logistic regression model in BigQuery ML to predict the income range of respondents in the US Census Dataset. The dataset [`census_adult_income`](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=census_bureau_usa&page=dataset) has about 32561 rows of data. \n",

    "1. Evaluate the linear regression model \n",
    "1. Make the income group predictions using the logistic regression model. \n",
