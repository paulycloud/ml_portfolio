# 08. Using BQML ARIMA Time Series to Predict Demand for NYC Taxis based on the Weather Forecast

This project used the ARIMA Time Series Model in BigQuery ML to perform multiple time-series forecasts with a single query. Different fast training strategies were applied to significantly speed up the query and evaluate forecasting accuracy. 

Goal is to build a predictive model using only BigQuery standard SQL. Since this is a Python notebook, we'll use some of the features of Python to analyze the data (ie. a loss function for calculating RSME), but the model itself and it's preditive comes comes from BigQuery alone. This is called BigQuery ML (BQML) and we couldn't be more excited to try it out!
