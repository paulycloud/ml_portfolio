# 03 How to use a linear_regression model to predict penguin weight on Penguin Public Dataset using BigQuery ML

This project used a linear regression model in BigQuery ML to predict the weight of a penguin based on the penguin's species, island of residence, culmen length and depth, flipper length, and sex.

## Objective 
1. Create a linear regression model 
1. Evaluate the linear regression model 
1. Make the penguin weight predictions using the linear regression model. 


## steps
1. Create the dataset and dataset table
1. Use the SELECT statement to examine the data 
1. Use the CREATE VIEW statement to compile your training data
1. Use the CREATE MODEL statement to create your linear regression model. 
1. Use the ML.EVALUATE function to evaluate the model data
1. Use the ML.PREDICT function to predict the penguin weight for a given set of data
1. Use the ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT function to explain prediction results with explainable AI Methods. 
1. Use the ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN function to know which features are the most important to determine the weight.
