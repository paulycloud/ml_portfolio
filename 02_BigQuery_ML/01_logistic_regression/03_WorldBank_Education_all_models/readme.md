# WorldBank International Debt Dataset 

The dataset [`International Debt`](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/the-world-bank/international-debt) contains both national and regional debt statistics captured by over 200 economic indicators. Time series data is available for those indicators from 1970 to 2015 for reporting countries. 

Multiple tables have been used to compile the data. The data was flattened to create a single working set: 
- Country series definitions 
- Country summary 
- International debt
- Series summary (496 series codes)
- Series times

### Actions taken: 
Multiple tables have been used to compile the data. The data was flattened to create a single working set: 

- Country series definitions
- Country summary
- International debt
- Series summary
- Series times


### Actions: 
1. Created a pivot table which takes the indicator codes as rows and tranforms them into columns in a new table. 
1. Created a merged table of the countries_data and the new pivot table we made
1. Created a table definition of the indicator_code and their description
1. Created the indicator_code description table dictionary

See the Data operations file for the series of transformations.
