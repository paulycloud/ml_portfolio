# WorldBank Health Dataset 

The dataset [`world_bank_health_population`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=1057666841514:3bb229234d7f4b379098581f0101e923&_ga=2.81369303.-1379782407.1673021064&project=paulkamau&ws=!1m9!1m3!3m2!1sbigquery-public-data!2sworld_bank_health_population!1m4!4m3!1sbigquery-public-data!2sworld_bank_health_population!3scountry_series_definitions) combines key health statistics from a variety of sources to provide a look at global health and population trends. It includes information on nutrition, reproductive health, education, immunization, and diseases from over 200 countries from 1960 - 2020

Multiple tables have been used to compile the data. The data was flattened to create a single working set: 

- Country series definitions 
- Country summary 
- Health nutrition population
- International debt
- Series summary 
- Series times

See the Data operations file for the series of transformations. 

# Potential ML Models
## Logisitic Regression Models: 
- TBD

## Linear Regression Models: How to use a linear regression model to:
### averages
- Predict the average Total alcohol consumption per capita (SH.ALC.PCAP.LI) using the World Bank Health dataset in BigQuery ML
- Predict the average age at first marriage for female (SP.DYN.SMAM.FE) using the World Bank Health dataset in BigQuery ML
- Predict the average age at first marriage for males (SP.DYN.SMAM.MA) using the World Bank Health dataset in BigQuery ML


#### annual 
- Predict the Total alcohol consumption per capita (SH.ALC.PCAP.LI) for the US in 2020 using the World Bank Health dataset in BigQuery ML
- Predict the age at first marriage for female (SP.DYN.SMAM.FE) for the US in 2020 using the World Bank Health dataset in BigQuery ML
- Predict the age at first marriage for males (SP.DYN.SMAM.MA) for the US using the World Bank Health dataset in BigQuery ML

## K-Means Clustering Models: 
- Dates with highest Cluster highest crime
- Cluster crimes 
- Cluster locations
- Cluster districts


## Timeseries Models: 
- Predict the Total alcohol consumption per capita (SH.ALC.PCAP.LI) for the US in 2022 using the World Bank Health dataset in BigQuery ML
