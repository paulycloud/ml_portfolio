# How to use a logistic classification regression model to predict Income bucket on census data using  BigQueryML

This project used a binary logistic regression model in BigQuery ML to predict the income range of respondents in the US Census Dataset. The dataset [`census_adult_income`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=census_bureau_usa&page=dataset) has about 32561 rows of data. 

## Objective 
1. TBD


## Key Concepts
1. Logistic regression 
1. Explainable AI
1. ML.EVALUATE
1. ML PREDICT

## steps
1. Create the dataset 
1. Use the SELECT statement to examine the data 
1. Use the CREATE VIEW statement to compile your training data
1. Use the CREATE MODEL statement to create your logistic regression model. 
1. Use the ML.EVALUATE function to evaluate the model data
1. Use the ML.PREDICT function to predict the income bracket for a given set of census participants.
1. Use the ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT function to explain prediction results with explainable AI Methods. 
1. Use the ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN function to know which features are the most important to determine the income bracket.
