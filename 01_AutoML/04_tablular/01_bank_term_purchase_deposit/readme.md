# Predict whether a Bank client will purchase a Term deposit (1=no, 2=yes) using AutoML Binary Logistic Regression  

The goal of the trained model is to predict whether a bank client will buy a term deposit (a type of investment) using features like age, income, and profession. This type of model can help banks determine who to focus its marketing resources on.

Key Concepts: 
- AutoML 
- Binary Classification


# Objective 
1. Build a binary classification model from tabular data using Vertex AI.
1. Train an AutoML Classification Model 
1. Request Predictions from a hosted model


## Dataset
This project uses the [Bank marketing](https://datahub.io/machine-learning/bank-marketing) open-source dataset. 

On the autoML console, “create dataset” and set the import file path to the CSV file: 

```bash
gs://cloud-ml-tables-data/bank-marketing.csv.
```
