# Binary text classification using TensorFlow 

This project uses a binary classifier to perform sentiment analysis on an IMDB text dataset. 

## Sentiment analysis
This notebook trains a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as *positive* or *negative*, based on the text of the review. 

It uses the [Large Movie Review Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) that contains the text of 50,000 movie reviews from the [Internet Movie Database](https://www.imdb.com/). These are split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The training and testing sets are *balanced*, meaning they contain an equal number of positive and negative reviews.
