# Text classification using Keras TensorFlow Hub: Movie reviews

This project uses a *binary* classification to categorize movie reviews as *positive* or *negative* using TensorFlow Hub. 

The Data source is the [IMDB dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/imdb) that contains the text of 50,000 movie reviews from the [Internet Movie Database](https://www.imdb.com/). These are split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The training and testing sets are *balanced*, meaning they contain an equal number of positive and negative reviews. 


## Data Source 
The [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset contains 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images in each class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The classes are mutually exclusive and there is no overlap between them.


## Steps
1. Import TensorFlow 
1. Download and prepare the CIFAR10 dataset
1. Verify the data
1. Create the Convolutional Base 
1. Add Dense Layers on Top 
1. Compile and Train the Model 
1. Evaluate the model
