# TensorFlow Projects
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.


Key Concepts
------------
***TensorFlow Extended (TFX)***: is an end-to-end platform for deploying production ML pipelines
When you're ready to move your models from research to production, use TFX to create and manage a production pipeline. A TFX pipeline is a sequence of components that implement an ML pipeline which is specifically designed for scalable, high-performance machine learning tasks. Components are built using TFX libraries which can also be used individually.

 
***TensorBoard***: provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation:

- Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy
- Visualizing the model graph (ops and layers)
- Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they change over time
- Projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space
- Displaying images, text, and audio data
- Profiling TensorFlow programs

TensorBoard.dev lets you easily host, track, and share your experiment results.

***TensorFlow Hub***: is a repository of trained machine learning models ready for fine-tuning and deployable anywhere. Reuse trained models like BERT and Faster R-CNN with just a few lines of code.

***TensorFlow Model Optimization***: The TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit is a suite of tools for optimizing ML models for deployment and execution. Among many uses, the toolkit supports techniques used to:

- Reduce latency and inference cost for cloud and edge devices (e.g. mobile, IoT).
- Deploy models to edge devices with restrictions on processing, memory, power-consumption, network usage, and model storage space.
- Enable execution on and optimize for existing hardware or new special purpose accelerators.

***TensorFlow Federated: Machine Learning on Decentralized Data***:
TensorFlow Federated (TFF) is an open-source framework for machine learning and other computations on decentralized data. TFF has been developed to facilitate open research and experimentation with Federated Learning (FL), an approach to machine learning where a shared global model is trained across many participating clients that keep their training data locally. For example, FL has been used to train prediction models for mobile keyboards without uploading sensitive typing data to servers.

TFF enables developers to simulate the included federated learning algorithms on their models and data, as well as to experiment with novel algorithms. Researchers will find starting points and complete examples for many kinds of research. The building blocks provided by TFF can also be used to implement non-learning computations, such as federated analytics. TFFâ€™s interfaces are organized in two main layers:

***TensorFlow Neural Structured Learning: Training with Structured Signals***: Neural Structured Learning (NSL) is a new learning paradigm to train neural networks by leveraging structured signals in addition to feature inputs. Structure can be explicit as represented by a graph or implicit as induced by adversarial perturbation.

***TensorFlow Graphics. Differentiable layers for graphics***: TensorFlow Graphics aims at making useful graphics functions widely accessible to the community by providing a set of differentiable graphics layers (e.g. cameras, reflectance models, mesh convolutions) and 3D viewer functionalities (e.g. 3D TensorBoard) that can be used in your machine learning models of choice.

***TensorFlow Datasets***: TensorFlow Datasets is a collection of datasets ready to use, with TensorFlow or other Python ML frameworks, such as Jax. All datasets are exposed as tf.data.Datasets , enabling easy-to-use and high-performance input pipelines. To get started see the guide and our list of datasets.

***TensorFlow Probability***: a library for probabilistic reasoning and statistical analysis.
TensorFlow Probability (TFP) is a Python library built on TensorFlow that makes it easy to combine probabilistic models and deep learning on modern hardware (TPU, GPU). It's for data scientists, statisticians, ML researchers, and practitioners who want to encode domain knowledge to understand data and make predictions.

***TensorFlow I/O***: is a collection of file systems and file formats that are not available in TensorFlow's built-in support. It provides useful extra Dataset, streaming, and file system extensions, and is maintained by TensorFlow SIG-IO.

***TensorFlow XLA***: XLA: Optimizing Compiler for Machine Learning
XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) is a domain-specific compiler for linear algebra that can accelerate TensorFlow models with potentially no source code changes. The results are improvements in speed and memory usage: e.g. in BERT MLPerf submission using 8 Volta V100 GPUs using XLA has achieved a ~7x performance improvement and ~5x batch size improvement:

***TensorFlow Decision Forests***: TF-Agents: A reliable, scalable and easy to use TensorFlow library for Contextual Bandits and Reinforcement Learning. TF-Agents makes implementing, deploying, and testing new Bandits and RL algorithms easier. It provides well tested and modular components that can be modified and extended. It enables fast code iteration, with good test integration and benchmarking. 

***TensorFlow SIG-Addons***: Extra functionality for TensorFlow, maintained by SIG-addons.
TensorFlow SIG Addons is a repository of community contributions that conform to well-established API patterns, but implement new functionality not available in core TensorFlow.

***TensorFlow Magenta***: An open source research project exploring the role of machine learning as a tool in the creative process. Magenta is distributed as an open source Python library, powered by TensorFlow. This library includes utilities for manipulating source data (primarily music and images), using this data to train machine learning models, and finally generating new content from these models.
