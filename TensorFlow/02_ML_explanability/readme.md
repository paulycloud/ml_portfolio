# Analyze Flight Predictions with Explainable AI with TensorFlow on Vertex AI 

[Qwiklabs](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/3384?catalog_rank=%7B%22rank%22%3A7%2C%22num_filters%22%3A0%2C%22has_search%22%3Atrue%7D&parent=catalog&search_id=17387787)


Key Concepts: 
- Explanable AI
- Vertex AI 
- Vertex AI Workbench
- TensorFlow

This lab involves creating a Vertex AI Workbench instance on which you develop a TensorFlow model in Jupyter notebook. You train the model, create an input data pipeline, deploy it to an endpoint, and get predictions.

You will explore the machine learning approach by using the TensorFlow library to carry out GPU-accelerated training. 

You will train a logistic regression model on all of the input values and learned that the model was unable to effectively use the new features like airport locations.



# Objective 
In this lab you create a Vertex AI Workbench instance on which you develop a TensorFlow model in Jupyter notebook to create Flight predictions. You train the model, create an input data pipeline, deploy it to an endpoint, and get predictions.
