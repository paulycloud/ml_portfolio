# Predict Fuel Efficiency using linear regression with TensorFlow Keras API


The purpose of this project is to use Linear regression to predict fuel efficiency. 

The dataset used was the classic [Auto MPG](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg) dataset and demonstrates how to build models to predict the fuel efficiency of the late-1970s and early 1980s automobiles. 

To do this, we will provide the models with a description of many automobiles from that time period. This description includes attributes like **cylinders, displacement, horsepower, and weight.**
