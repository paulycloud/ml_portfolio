# Use TensorFlow Keras Sequential API to classify Flower Images.

This project demonstrates training a simple [Convolutional Neural Network](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#convolutional_neural_network) (CNN) to classify [CIFAR images](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). Because this tutorial uses the [Keras Sequential API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview), creating and training your model will take just a few lines of code.

# Objective 


## Data Source 
The [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset contains 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images in each class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The classes are mutually exclusive and there is no overlap between them.

## Steps
1. Import TensorFlow 
1. Examine and understand data 
1. Build an input pipeline 
1. Build the model 
1. Train the model 
1. Test the model 
1. Improve the model and repeat the process
1. Convert a saved model to a TensorFlow Lite model
