# Use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR Images.

This project demonstrates training a simple [Convolutional Neural Network](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#convolutional_neural_network) (CNN) to classify [CIFAR images](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). Because this tutorial uses the [Keras Sequential API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview), creating and training your model will take just a few lines of code.


## Data Source 
The [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset contains 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images in each class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The classes are mutually exclusive and there is no overlap between them.

## Steps
1. Import TensorFlow 
1. Download and prepare the CIFAR10 dataset
1. Verify the data
1. Create the Convolutional Base 
1. Add Dense Layers on Top 
1. Compile and Train the Model 
1. Evaluate the model
