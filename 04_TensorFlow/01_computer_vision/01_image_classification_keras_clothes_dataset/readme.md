# Use TensorFlow's computer vision to recognize different items of clothing.

# Objective 
Create and train a computer vision model to recognize different items of clothing using TensorFlow on Google Cloud Compute Engine. 

The goal is for the model to figure out the relationship between the training data and its labels. Once training is complete, you want the model to see fresh images of clothing that resembles your training data and make predictions about what class of clothing they belong to.

# steps
1. Set up the development environment in the IDE
1. Design, compile, train and evaluate your model
1. Save and load models
1. Write your own callbacks to customize behaviour during training
1. Complete a series of exercises to guide you through experimenting with the different layers of the network
